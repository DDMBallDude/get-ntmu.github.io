**NTMU PACK: OrthodoxWin32**

DESCRIPTION: This pack includes winhlp.exe from Windows XP X64. en-US (US English) only.

NOTE: In Windows Vista and later Windows versions, the Windows help file viewer does not work. This pack therefore restores support for .hlp Windows help files.
NOTE-2: Although derived from the x64 version of Windows XP, the winhlp32 provided is a 32-bit program.

Enjoy!
